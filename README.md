# mindforge-lab
• Currently it's literally what the name says, "lab", just a place for me to experiment my learning ideas. Maybe get help from some nice people 😁
# How you can help me ?
• If you are experienced developer, then maybe drop tips, guides, resources, etc for me to start as a developer, every help is appreciated 🙂 👍.
# What am I doing ?
• Nothing. Just made a room to keep myself motivated everyday to learn and improve and explore what other genius like you are doing out there. 

• Currently learning CPP from learncpp.com and learning algorithms, data structures and how computer works. If it gets updated that means, I will make a decent project on my repo based on CPP. 🫡
